# Game Plan

### Breakout Variant
My three favorite Breakout Variants were Super Breakout, Jet Ball, and Vortex. 
- In Super Breakout, I enjoyed how the new levels filled into the map. It created an interesting advantage of ending the round with the ball high up to improve the "waterfall" effect as new bricks were added. 
- In Jet Ball, I thought the animations - specifically the paddle dip on impact, the ball trail, and the variety of brick animations on destruction were aesthetically pleasing. 
- In Vortex, I was impressed by the unique 3D feel of the game.
