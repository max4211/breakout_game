#### Next steps
- Refactor all public methods
- Refactor general code
- Comment all methods and classes (JAVADOC)
- Write up FOLDER_PURPOSE.md doc? (check piazza)

#### Design decisions
- All objects extend shape classes
- Groups added to root, level design just changes bricks
- Brick shape construction is very dynamic (according to level generator and text file)
